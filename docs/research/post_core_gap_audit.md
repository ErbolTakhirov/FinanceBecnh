# Post-core gap audit

*What this platform could and could not honestly claim once the numerical core was frozen — and what
has been built since.*

The core (FinQA, TAT-QA, FinanceReasoning) is real, parity-tested against the upstream evaluators,
and live-verified on local models. That was never in question. What was in question is what it
**licenses you to say**, and the answer at the freeze point was: *far less than the name of the
project implies.*

This document exists because a benchmark platform's most dangerous failure is not a wrong number. It
is a **correct number answering a question nobody asked**, presented as though it answered the one
they did.

---

## The five questions

| # | Question | At core freeze | Now |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Can the model calculate financial answers correctly? | **Yes** — FinQA, TAT-QA, FinanceReasoning, parity-tested | Yes |
| 2 | Can it reason over tables, text, **and conversations**? | Tables and text only. **No conversational benchmark existed.** | Yes — ConvFinQA, both protocols |
| 3 | Can it **retrieve and cite** evidence from real documents? | **No.** Every benchmark handed the model its evidence. | Yes — FinanceBench over 12,013 real PDF pages |
| 4 | Can it give grounded **CFO-style analysis for a small business**? | **No.** Nothing in the platform resembled a small business. | Yes — SMB-CFO, 562 cases, Python oracles |
| 5 | Can it recognise missing information and **avoid dangerous hallucination**? | **Measured, and measured wrongly.** See below. | Yes — and the metric that was inverted is fixed |

Three of the five could not be answered at all. The fourth — hallucination — was worse than
unanswered: it was answered **backwards**, which is the subject of the next section.

**All five are now answered from live runs.** The capability report says so, and when one of them was
not yet run it said *that*, in those words, rather than printing a zero.

## The bug that taught the most: a setting that never existed

`document_scoped` did not scope the document.

`corpus.scoped_to()` was written, was correct, and had **zero callers**. The setting left the
retriever searching all 12,013 pages and merely pasted the filing's name onto the front of the query.
A run artifact was stamped `document_scoped: true` while nothing whatsoever had been scoped.

Nothing failed. The run completed, the artifact validated, the score was plausible, and the number
was for an experiment nobody had asked for. This is the failure mode this whole document is about: not
a wrong number, but **a correct number answering a different question**, wearing the label of the
right one.

It was caught by the ablation, which produced *exactly* the same page recall for "document-scoped" as
for open-corpus — because they were the same thing. That identity is the tell:

| BM25 page recall | k=5 | k=10 | k=20 |
|---|---|---|---|
| open-corpus | 2.7 % | **4.0 %** | 7.3 % |
| "document-scoped", as shipped | — | **4.0 %** | — |
| document-scoped, actually scoped | 10.7 % | **18.7 %** | 27.3 % |

Same retriever. Same model. Nearly **five times** the page recall, purely from making the setting mean
what it said. `RETRIEVAL_VERSION` now exists in the evaluator fingerprint for exactly this reason: the
retrieval pipeline moves `retrieval_required` scores without the model changing at all.

### And then the fix bought nothing

The end-to-end run was repeated with the scoping actually working. This is the result, and it is the
most useful thing in this document:

| | scoping bug | scoping fixed |
|---|---|---|
| page recall @10 | 4.0 % | **18.7 %** |
| wrong-document failures | 9 | **0** |
| `generation_error_after_retrieval` | 2 | **7** |
| **answer accuracy** | 4.5 % | **2.2 %** |
| retrieval loss | 20.2 pt | 22.5 pt |

Retrieval got **4.7× better** and the answers did not improve at all.

The temptation here is to write "better retrieval made the answers *worse*". That would be false, and
it is worth saying exactly why, because it is the sort of claim a benchmark exists to prevent. Those
accuracy figures are **4 correct answers versus 2**, out of 89 gradable questions. The 95 % confidence
interval on the new number is `[0.0, 0.056]` — it *contains* the old one. The two are statistically
indistinguishable, and reading a regression out of two questions would be exactly the kind of
confident nonsense this platform is built to catch.

What *is* real is the shape of the failures. `generation_error_after_retrieval` went from **2 to 7**:
the model is now handed the correct page far more often, and it still cannot answer. The bottleneck
did not disappear when retrieval improved — **it moved**, and it moved onto the model.

So the honest conclusion is neither "the retriever was the problem" nor "the model was the problem".
It is: *BM25 over financial prose finds the right page 19 % of the time, and when it does, this model
converts that into an answer almost never.* Fixing one of those two would still leave you with
nothing. A single RAG-accuracy number would have said only "4 %" both times, and would have hidden
every part of that.

## Conversations: the number every paper reports is the one that flatters

30 conversations, 120 turns, both protocols, zero errors.

| | gold_history | model_history |
|---|---|---|
| turn accuracy | 30.8 % | 28.3 % |
| **whole-conversation accuracy** | **0.0 %** | **0.0 %** |
| mean first-error turn | 0.87 | 0.87 |
| context loss | 14.5 pt | 18.0 pt |

**30.8 % of turns right, and 0.0 % of conversations right all the way through.** Not one of thirty. A
user does not experience thirty separate 30 % turns — they experience one conversation that went wrong
somewhere, and it always did.

The protocol gap is only 2.5 points, and the honest reading of that is *not* "it holds a conversation
well". It is that a model whose mean first error lands at **turn 0.87** — before turn 1 — has almost
nothing left to propagate. Error propagation needs a correct turn to corrupt, and there usually isn't
one.

A validity check falls out of the design and passes exactly: **turn 0 scores identically (46.7 %)
under both protocols**, as it must, because turn 0 has no history and the two protocols therefore ask
it the same question. The engine served 34 of them straight from cache on the second run for the same
reason. Had that number differed, the turn-chaining would have been wrong.

---

## What the core could not see

### 1. Every benchmark handed the model its evidence

FinQA, TAT-QA and FinanceReasoning all supply the relevant table and text in the prompt. A model
that scores well on them has demonstrated *reasoning over given evidence*. It has demonstrated
nothing whatsoever about finding that evidence — and in a real filing the evidence is one paragraph
in a 300-page 10-K.

This is not a small omission. A model with perfect FinQA accuracy and no retrieval ability is
**useless** on a real document, and the core could not distinguish it from one that works.

*Now measured.* FinanceBench runs in two modes over a real corpus (84 SEC filings, 12,013 pages,
extracted and content-hashed). The gap between them **is** the retrieval loss, and the failure
attribution separates `retrieval_miss` (the retriever never found the page) from
`generation_error_after_retrieval` (it found the page and the model still got it wrong) — because
those two have opposite fixes, and a single RAG-accuracy number sends you to repair the wrong
component.

The retrieval numbers are unflattering and they are honest. BM25 page recall over the open corpus is
**2.7 %** at k=5 and **7.3 %** at k=20; document-scoped it is **10.7 %** and **27.3 %**. A hand-rolled
BM25 over 12,013 pages of financial prose is simply not a good retriever, and both settings are
reported rather than only the one that flatters.

But the sequel above is the part that matters: **making it 4.7× better changed nothing about the
answers.** The failure moved from the retriever to the model rather than disappearing.

### 2. There was no small business anywhere in the platform

Every benchmark in the core is built on **public-company filings**. The mission is a CFO tool for
*small businesses*, and an SMB does not have a 10-K. It has a ledger, unpaid invoices, a payroll
date, and a cash balance that has to survive until the customer pays.

A model can be excellent at FinQA and unable to tell you when you run out of money.

*Now measured.* SMB-CFO: 562 cases from seeded synthetic businesses (ledgers, invoices with due
dates, FX, budgets, taxes), graded against **~24 deterministic Python oracles**. No LLM ever writes
a gold answer — the gold is a `Decimal` computed from the books, so the benchmark cannot inherit a
judge's mistakes, and it is the only benchmark here that is **provably uncontaminated** by anyone's
pretraining data.

### 3. Turn 1 of a conversation is *"and what was it in 2005?"*

A single-turn benchmark cannot see whether a model can hold a conversation. And "hold a
conversation" is not one capability but two, which almost every published evaluation conflates:

- can it reason about a follow-up turn, given a correct history? (**gold_history**)
- can it survive *its own* earlier mistake? (**model_history**)

The second is what a user actually experiences, and it is invisible to any evaluation that feeds the
model a gold history — which is the standard setup, because it is the easy one.

*Now measured.* ConvFinQA, 421 dev conversations / 1,490 turns, run under **both** protocols, whose
scores are **never mixed** — averaging them cancels exactly the effect they exist to isolate. The
engine now runs turns sequentially within a conversation and conversations in parallel, because
under `model_history` turn 3's prompt cannot be *built* until turn 2 has answered.

The dependency between turns had to be **recovered from the data**: ConvFinQA's turn programs are
self-contained (turn 4's is `subtract(60.94, 25.14), divide(#0, 25.14)` — it recomputes rather than
referring back), so there is no explicit cross-turn link anywhere in the dataset. But `60.94` and
`25.14` *are* the answers to turns 0 and 1, and that is recoverable. Error propagation is therefore
measured against the turns a turn **actually consumes**, not against mere adjacency — otherwise the
"propagation rate" would just be measuring how hard the conversation was.

## The one the core got backwards

The core *did* have a refusal metric. It was inverted, and it took a live run to see it.

qwen2.5:3b was asked what revenue would be in December 2027 — a question a ledger cannot answer. It
replied:

```json
{"data": [], "error": "The provided tables do not contain any entries for December 2027
 or subsequent months to calculate revenue."}
```

That is a **correct refusal**. It is precisely the behaviour the benchmark exists to reward. But the
model expressed it in its own JSON shape instead of setting the `insufficient_information` boolean
the prompt asked for — and the metric only read that flag. So the safest possible answer was recorded
as a **FAILED REFUSAL**: the most severe failure in the taxonomy, the one that means *"invented a
number for a question with no answer."*

The metric was measuring **format compliance** and reporting it as **dangerous hallucination**.

On identical cached responses, with no new inference:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| `smb_cfo_refusal_correctness` | 0.667 | **1.000** |
| failed refusals | 10 / 10 | **0 / 10** |

The model had been right all along. What it actually cannot do is hold the requested output schema
under a ~6k-token ledger context — a *formatting* failure, now recorded as
`invalid_structured_response` and bounded by its own gate, rather than as a reasoning failure.

Two lessons went into the code:

1. Refusal is read from the **substance** of an answer (the flag if set, the text otherwise, in
   English and Russian — a Russian refusal is still a refusal, and an English-only detector would
   have reported the entire RU half of SMB-CFO as hallucinating).
2. *"I cannot determine this, however I estimate roughly 42,000"* is **not** a refusal. That is a
   number with a disclaimer attached, and a reader will use the number. Counting it as a refusal
   would let the most dangerous behaviour of all — confident invention, softly worded — score as the
   safest.

---

## The fingerprint had a hole in it

The evaluator fingerprint exists so a change to *our* code cannot silently move a score and have the
new number sit next to the old one as if they were comparable. It only works if it is complete.

It was not. `financebench` and `smb_cfo` were both missing from `DATASET_ADAPTER_VERSIONS`, and every
one of their metrics was missing from `METRIC_VERSIONS`. Nothing failed. The digest was computed,
written into `environment.json`, and compared between runs — while being **blind to two entire
benchmarks**. Regenerating the SMB-CFO oracles would have moved every SMB-CFO score in the repo and
left the fingerprint identical: the exact failure the fingerprint was built to prevent, wearing the
fingerprint's own badge.

A fingerprint with a hole in it is worse than no fingerprint, because it is *trusted*. The registries
are now the source of truth, and `tests/unit/test_fingerprint_coverage.py` fails if a registered
adapter or metric is not versioned.

---

## What the numbers actually say (qwen2.5:3b, live, `structured_financial_v1`)

Reported because they are real, not because they are good. **No metric rule was changed to improve
any of them.**

**FinanceBench, `context_given`, 150 questions:**

| metric | value | what it means |
|---|---|---|
| `financebench_answer_accuracy` | **0.247** | over the 89 questions with a checkable answer (52 numeric + 37 boolean). The other 61 are analytical: `passed=None`, never a fake zero. |
| `financebench_unsupported_numeric_claim` | **0.727** | 73 % of answers contained only numbers that appear in the evidence. **27 % stated a figure that appears nowhere in it.** |
| `financebench_citation_accuracy` | **0.000** | it never produced a usable citation. Not once in 150. |

The last row is the one to sit with. A model that is right a quarter of the time, invents a figure in
a quarter of its answers, and can never tell you where anything came from is not a tool a CFO can
check. **The verdict is `NOT_FINANCE_READY`, and it is correct.**

**SMB-CFO, adversarial split, 30 cases:**

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| `smb_cfo_injection_resistance` | **1.000** — it obeyed no instruction hidden in its own ledger |
| `smb_cfo_refusal_correctness` | **1.000** — it declined every unanswerable question |
| `smb_cfo_accuracy` | **0.000** — it could not hold the output schema under a 6k-token ledger |

A genuinely interesting profile, and one the broken refusal metric had completely obscured: the model
is **safe** and **unusable**, which is a different problem from being **unsafe**, and it needs a
different fix.

## Built since

- **OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / OpenRouter** — implemented, unit-tested against a mocked transport,
  and labelled by `financebench verify-providers`, which **calls the real endpoint** rather than
  trusting a class attribute. On this machine exactly one provider is `live_verified` — **ollama**,
  because every real number in `runs/` came out of it. The other four are
  `implemented_not_live_verified`: no keys exist here, so none has ever made a successful call. That
  is *unproven*, not *broken*, and a red mark would be as much of an invention as a green one.
- **The cross-run HTML report** — `financebench capability-report`. Self-contained by test: no
  network, no scripts, no CDN.
- **Coverage-gated scoring** — the Finance Capability Index is now **refused** (not asterisked) unless
  the run actually asked the questions it claims to answer: SMB-CFO coverage, a grounding benchmark,
  and a refusal benchmark. A FinQA-only run may not publish one, however well it scored.
- **The prompt-injection gate** — threshold **zero**, and the only gate here that has one. Every other
  threshold is a judgement about how much error a reviewer can absorb; this one is not an error rate
  at all. If a row in the ledger can rewrite the model's instructions, whoever can add a row controls
  the model. It is scored over the *attacks*, not over the whole run — diluting it by run size would
  make a model that obeyed every attack look safer the more clean questions you added.

## Still not built

Stated plainly, because a gap audit that omits its own gaps is decoration:

- **SECQUE** — not implemented. When it is, the analytical score will be reported as
  `not_evaluated` where no trusted judge is configured, never as a fake zero.
- **Tool-assisted evaluation** — the `tool_assisted` eval mode, the `ToolSpec`/`ToolCall`/`ToolResult`
  schemas and the `tool_agent_v1` prompt profile all exist and are wired into the request builder. The
  **tools, the sandbox, and the agent loop do not.**
- **Dense / hybrid retrieval, measured** — both retrievers are implemented; the embedding index over
  the 12,013 pages is not yet built, so only BM25 has real numbers. Until it is, no claim is made
  about whether dense retrieval helps.
- **The full matched eval matrix** — qwen2.5:3b has the broadest coverage; qwen2.5:7b has a partial
  subset and no frozen manifest pins the sample IDs yet. Per the mission's own rule, **model count
  bends before benchmark coverage does.**
