"""SECQUE: the benchmark that most tempts an evaluation suite to lie.

Its gold is an expert's prose. There is no exact-match metric and there cannot be one, so the
temptation is to invent a number — a benchmark with no score looks broken. These tests pin the two
honest alternatives instead: grade the parts that are genuinely checkable, and say *not applicable*
about the parts that are not.
