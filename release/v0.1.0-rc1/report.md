## The headline: tools do not help either model — and they *destroy* the small one

The paired experiment ran the **same 150 sample ids** (FinQA + TAT-QA, frozen manifest
`tool_paired_v1`, `id_hash=7c839cfbc46cb862`) four ways: each model answering directly, and each with a
calculator, a formula registry, a table query, a CSV query and an FX converter available. Same
questions, same evaluator (`80ca8a678b1c4fa1`), same prompt profile, temperature 0, zero provider
errors.

| | 3B direct | 3B + tools | 7B direct | 7B + tools |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FinQA answer accuracy | 0.1467 | **0.0267** | **0.2667** | 0.2400 |
| TAT-QA exact match | 0.1733 | **0.0667** | **0.2667** | 0.2667 |
| exact match (all 150) | 0.1400 | **0.0600** | 0.1667 | 0.2000 |

### Paired bootstrap — the four comparisons that matter

| comparison | metric | difference | 95% CI | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3B direct **vs** 3B + tools | FinQA | +0.120 | `[+0.040, +0.213]` | **tools HURT, significantly** |
| 3B direct **vs** 3B + tools | TAT-QA | +0.107 | `[+0.027, +0.200]` | **tools HURT, significantly** |
| 7B direct **vs** 7B + tools | FinQA | +0.027 | `[-0.080, +0.133]` | no significant difference |
| 7B direct **vs** 7B + tools | TAT-QA | +0.000 | `[-0.093, +0.093]` | **identical** |
| 3B + tools **vs** 7B direct | FinQA | −0.240 | `[-0.347, -0.133]` | **7B wins by 10×** |
| 3B + tools **vs** 7B direct | TAT-QA | −0.200 | `[-0.307, -0.093]` | **7B wins** |

**The two models fail differently, and the difference is the finding.**

### Why: the 3B never picks the tools up. The 7B does — and gains nothing.

| tool metric | 3B | 7B |
|---|---|---|
| `tool_invocation_rate` | **0.013** (2 of 150) | **0.193** (29 of 150) |
| `tool_argument_validity` | 0.500 (n=2) | **0.931** (n=29) |
| `tool_execution_success` | 0.500 (n=2) | 0.552 (n=29) |
| `tool_result_utilization` | 1.000 (n=1) | **0.688** (n=16) |
| `tool_error_recovery` | 0.000 (n=1) | 0.188 (n=16) |
| `tool_hallucination_rate` | 1.000 (n=2) | 1.000 (n=29) — neither ever invented a tool |
| `tool_security_rejection` | **1.000** (n=150) | **1.000** (n=150) — **the sandbox was never breached** |

The 3B calls a tool on **2 of 150 questions**. It is not misusing the toolbox; it is *ignoring* it —
and it still loses five-sixths of its FinQA answers. So the damage is done by the **agent scaffolding
itself**: the JSON envelope asking the model to choose between emitting a tool call and emitting an
answer. A 3B model asked to route its reasoning through a protocol gets worse at the underlying
arithmetic *while ignoring the protocol*, and pays 27% more tokens (207,473 vs 163,028) to do it.

The 7B is a different story. It invokes tools **15× more often**, forms valid arguments **93%** of the
time, and uses what comes back **69%** of the time. It can work the protocol. **And it gains nothing
for it** — every 7B direct-vs-tools interval contains zero.

The `n=1` and `n=2` in the 3B column are printed with their denominators and are **not claims about
anything**. A bare `tool_result_utilization = 1.000` for the 3B would be a lie by omission.

### The six questions, answered

**Does tool access improve correctness?** **No.** It significantly *reduces* it for the 3B, and makes
no significant difference for the 7B. Not one interval favours tools.

**Does it reduce catastrophic numeric errors?** No.

**Does the model actually invoke tools?** The 3B: almost never (1.3%). The 7B: sometimes (19.3%).

**Does it use correct tool output?** The 7B does, 69% of the time (n=16). The 3B executed one tool
successfully in the entire run.

**Does orchestration introduce new failures?** **Yes — and for the 3B that is the entire effect.**

**Can a smaller model with tools outperform a larger model without tools?**
**Emphatically no.** 3B+tools scores **0.027** against 7B-direct's **0.267** — *ten times worse*, with
the interval excluding zero on every metric. On this evidence, spending a small model's context budget
on a tool protocol is strictly worse than spending it on a bigger model.

## The release group: the only run that can earn a Finance Capability Index

220 frozen samples (`release_v0_1`, `id_hash=e9b815fdb84fb9ab`), stratified across six benchmarks and
across SMB-CFO's **24 task families**, plus 10 adversarial prompt-injection samples. This is the only
run whose coverage can support an index at all: the FCI is withheld unless **one** run asked about
SMB-CFO *and* document grounding *and* refusal together.

Both models: **220/220 evaluated, zero provider errors**, same manifest, same evaluator.

| metric | qwen2.5:3b | qwen2.5:7b |
|---|---|---|
| `convfinqa_turn_accuracy` | 0.300 (n=20) | 0.350 (n=20) |
| `exact_match` | 0.077 (n=220) | 0.086 (n=220) |
| `finance_reasoning_accuracy` | 0.000 (n=40) | 0.025 (n=40) |
| `financebench_answer_accuracy` | 0.231 (n=26) | 0.423 (n=26) |
| `financebench_citation_accuracy` | 0.000 (n=1) | 0.000 (n=39) |
| `financebench_unsupported_numeric_claim` | 0.625 (n=40) | 0.725 (n=40) |
| `finqa_answer_accuracy` | 0.150 (n=40) | 0.350 (n=40) |
| `smb_cfo_accuracy` | 0.000 (n=37) | 0.000 (n=37) |
| `smb_cfo_injection_resistance` | 1.000 (n=2) | 1.000 (n=2) |
| `smb_cfo_refusal_correctness` | 0.950 (n=40) | 0.950 (n=40) |
| `tatqa_exact_match` | 0.200 (n=40) | 0.225 (n=40) |
| `tatqa_f1` | 0.311 (n=40) | 0.324 (n=40) |
| `tatqa_scale_accuracy` | 0.725 (n=40) | 0.700 (n=40) |

| | 3B | 7B |
|---|---|---|
| **Finance Capability Index** | **WITHHELD** | **WITHHELD** |
| verdict | **NOT_FINANCE_READY** | **NOT_FINANCE_READY** |
| `numeric_accuracy` (gate ≥ 0.50) | **0.116 — FAIL, critical** | **0.189 — FAIL, critical** |
| `invalid_output_rate` (gate ≤ 0.10) | **0.173 — FAIL** | **0.150 — FAIL** |
| `prompt_injection_obeyed_rate` (gate 0.0) | **0.000 — PASS** | **0.000 — PASS** |
| `catastrophic_numeric_error_rate` (≤ 0.05) | 0.036 — PASS | 0.032 — PASS |
| `unsupported_claim_rate` (≤ 0.10) | 0.000 — PASS | 0.000 — PASS |

The index is **refused, not asterisked.** `capabilities.json` records why in plain words. The 7B is
better at almost everything — FinQA 0.350 vs 0.150, FinanceBench 0.423 vs 0.231 — and it is **not
enough to clear a single critical gate.**

### `smb_cfo_accuracy = 0.0000` for BOTH models — and it is a FORMAT failure

Neither model answers a single small-business CFO question correctly. That benchmark is this project's
actual subject, and its gold answers come from **Python oracles, never an LLM** — so it is the one
benchmark here that cannot have been memorised.

But the zero is not an arithmetic failure. The model answers in **its own JSON shape**:

```json
{"monthly_budget": 2595, "category": "Cloud hosting"}
{"data": [{"supplier": "Northwind Studio", "amount": 2486.58}]}
```

when the prompt asked for `{"answer": ..., "numeric_value": ...}`. It may well hold the right number
— it simply cannot say it in the requested envelope, so nothing can be read out. That is counted
separately (**38 `invalid_structured_response`** of 220 for the 3B, 33 for the 7B) and it is what fails
the `invalid_output_rate` gate.

`finance_reasoning_accuracy` — 0.000 (3B) and 0.025 (7B) — *is* a genuine reasoning failure: the models
emit numbers and they are simply wrong (1328 where the answer is 1152; 368 where it is 22).

**The distinction matters because the fixes are opposite.** One needs a better model; the other needs a
parser or a prompt. A single "accuracy: 0.0" would have sent you to fix the wrong one.

Meanwhile `smb_cfo_refusal_correctness` is **0.950** for both: when the books genuinely cannot answer
a question, both models correctly decline. They know what they do not know. They just cannot say what
they do.

**The prompt-injection gate fired for the first time in this project's history** — the release manifest
is the first run to carry real injection samples — and **both models resisted every one**.

## SECQUE: both models, on identical stratified samples

80 tasks, stratified across Analysis / Comparison / Ratio / Risk. Same 80 sample ids for both models,
same evaluator.

| | qwen2.5:3b | qwen2.5:7b |
|---|---|---|
| `secque_numeric_agreement` | 0.080 (n=62, 18 n/a) | **0.115** (n=62, 18 n/a) |
| `secque_filing_identification` | 0.607 (n=56) | 0.494 (n=62) |
| `secque_unsupported_numeric_claim` | 0.938 (n=80) | 0.900 (n=80) |
| `secque_comparison_direction` | 1.000 (**n=17 of 80**) | 1.000 (**n=12 of 80**) |
| `exact_match` | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| **Financial Core Score** | **0.354** | **0.307** |
| **analytical correctness** | **`NOT_EVALUATED`** | **`NOT_EVALUATED`** |
| verdict | **NOT_FINANCE_READY** | **NOT_FINANCE_READY** |

> ⚠️ **`comparison_direction = 1.000` is not what it looks like.** It is graded on 12 of 80 samples
> for the 7B, and it **abstains precisely when a model contradicts itself** — which is when the
> question is interesting. On the Nike EBIT question the model invented both figures *and inverted the
> conclusion*, and the metric returned not-applicable, because the answer contained "increased" *and*
> "decrease" (it discussed a segment alongside the total). Deciding which of two contradictory
> directional claims is the headline is a guess, and **a metric that guesses is worse than one that
> abstains** — so it abstains, and its `n` is printed beside it. Read it as *"of the twelve questions
> where the model committed to one direction, it got all twelve right"*, and nothing more. The
> hallucination detector **did** catch that answer: both invented figures are flagged.

**Both models agree with the expert analyst's figures roughly one time in ten**, and the 7B names the
**wrong company in 51% of its answers**. These are not models that can read a 10-K.

> ⚠️ **The 3B's higher filing-identification score is NOT a supportable claim.** It is graded on **56**
> of 80 samples versus the 7B's **62** — the metric is not-applicable when the model declines or
> produces nothing to check — so the 3B's number sits on a **smaller, self-selected subset**. Different
> denominators; not a comparison.

**Before this release, both models reported a Financial Core Score of 0.900.** Every SECQUE capability
dimension was being fed the *absence-of-hallucination* metric, so "document grounding" and "table/text
reasoning" were both reporting "did it avoid inventing a number" — which a model that emits no numbers
passes perfectly. Fixed; see `manual_validity_review.md`.

## Retrieval: doubling page recall changed *nothing*, and broke the output contract

The full ablation over a real **12,013-page, 84-filing** corpus, and then — the expensive part — the
same **150 sample ids** generated against, twice.

### 1. Retrieval performance (no model in the loop)

| retriever | scope | page recall @20 | doc recall @20 | query latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bm25 | open-corpus | 7.3% | 79.3% | 59 ms |
| bm25 | doc-scoped | 27.3% | 100% | **1 ms** |
| dense | open-corpus | 2.0% | **27.3%** | — |
| dense | doc-scoped | 34.0% | 100% | — |
| hybrid | open-corpus | 4.7% | 67.3% | — |
| **hybrid** | **doc-scoped** | **38.7%** | 100% | — |

Two things fall out that no single number would have shown:

**Dense retrieval is dramatically worse at finding the company** — 27.3% document recall against BM25's
79.3%. The questions name a company and a year, which is a *lexical* match, and the embedding blurs
exactly that. It is better at finding the *page* once the company is known. Hybrid gets both.

**Document scoping is strictly dominant:** 4.7× better recall *and* **59× faster** (59 ms → 1 ms). There
is no trade-off to weigh. And **recall@1 is 2.7%** — the first page retrieved is almost never the right
one, which is the number that matters most for a model with a short context.

### 2. Does better retrieval produce better answers? **No.**

Two generated arms, identical 150 sample ids, identical evaluator, plus the oracle:

| arm | page recall | **answer accuracy** | retrieval misses | gen-fail-after-retrieval |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| bm25 / doc-scoped / k=10 | 18.7% | **0.0225** (n=89) | 78 | **7** |
| **hybrid / doc-scoped / k=20** | **38.7%** | **0.0225** (n=89) | 59 | **22** |
| **oracle** (gold evidence handed over) | 100% | **0.2360** (n=89) | — | — |

**Paired bootstrap, bm25 vs hybrid: difference `+0.000`, 95% CI `[-0.034, +0.034]` — includes zero.**

Retrieval improved by **2.07×**. Answer accuracy did not move by a single question. And
`generation_error_after_retrieval` **tripled: 7 → 22.**

### 3. Why: the model drowns in its own evidence

All 22 of those failures are the **same failure**, and it is not a reasoning failure. The model returns
valid JSON *in a shape nobody asked for*:

```json
{"FOO": "To calculate the FY2017-FY2019 3 year average of capex..."}
{"source": {"$pillar$: financials, $section$: cash-flow-statement...}}
{"ERROR": "Template must contain a 'class' field."}
{"error_message": "Year-end AR value not found in provided data"}
```

The k=20 prompt is **83,313 characters** — roughly 20k tokens, **two-thirds of qwen2.5:3b's context
window**. Handed twice as much evidence, the model finds the right page more often and then **abandons
the output contract entirely.**

### The three points, read together

- Retrieval 18.7% → 38.7% : answer accuracy **2.25% → 2.25%**. Retrieval is *not* the binding
  constraint.
- Retrieval 38.7% → 100% (oracle) : answer accuracy **2.25% → 23.60%**. A **10× jump.**

So the model *can* use this evidence — it does so ten times better when handed the gold pages. What it
cannot do is find the answer inside 83k characters of retrieved context *and* keep to the requested
format. **The bottleneck is not the retriever, and it is not the model's reasoning. It is the amount of
context we are pouring into a 3B model, and the output contract that collapses under it.**

That is a finding a single "RAG accuracy" number would have hidden completely — and it would have sent
you to buy a better embedding model, which the evidence here says would not have moved the answer by
one question.

## Coverage, and what is refused

| | |
|---|---|
| Evaluator fingerprint | `80ca8a678b1c4fa1` — every run on this page was scored by it |
| Frozen manifests | `tool_paired_v1` (150 ids), `release_v0_1` (220 ids, stratified across SMB-CFO's 24 task families + 10 injection samples) |
| Parity tests | **17 passed, ZERO skipped**, against the real upstream FinQA / TAT-QA / FinanceReasoning evaluators |
| Security tests | 411 passed |
| Sandbox gate | **PASSED** (`tool_security_rejection = 1.000` over 150 samples) |

### What is NOT measured

- **SECQUE analytical correctness: `NOT_EVALUATED`.** `llama3.2:3b` fails calibration with a **41%
  false-positive rate** against a 20% bar — it never rejects a good answer, and waves through
  two-thirds of answers that name the **wrong company** or contain an **invented figure**. `qwen3:8b`
  returns an empty string (a thinking model; it spends its budget inside `<think>`). `qwen2.5:7b` is
  refused: same family as the candidate. **This is a measurement, not an omission, and never a zero.**
- **No API provider is live-verified.** OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter are implemented and
  unit-tested against a mocked transport. **No API key exists here; none has ever made a call.**
- **No multimodal run exists.** `multimodal_coverage: 0.0` everywhere.

---

## Limitations

See [`docs/known_limitations.md`](../../docs/known_limitations.md). The load-bearing ones:

- **The 7B does not fit in the GPU** (4.7 GB of weights, 4 GB of VRAM) and spills to CPU. Every
  latency comparison here measures *this machine*, not the models.
- **The PDF text extraction strips spaces out of line items** — `Propertyandequipment,net`. The
  evidence is present and the model cannot find it. This depresses every FinanceBench number in this
  repo, and it is a *pipeline* limitation, not a model one.
- **`financebench_answer_accuracy` allows a 1% band**, which credits an answer wrong by $27M
  (`id_10285`: gold $12,645.00, model 12,672.0). I judge that too loose, and I have **not changed it** —
  tightening a tolerance after seeing which answers it credits is selecting a metric by its effect on
  the score, and that the effect would be to *lower* the score does not make it acceptable.

---

**A good score here does not certify that a model is safe to run unsupervised against real money.** It
means it did well on these questions, on this hardware, on this date. Neither of these models did.
