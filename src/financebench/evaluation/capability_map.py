"""The ten capability dimensions, and how a sample's score reaches one.

Two design decisions here matter more than the list itself.

**Macro-averaging, not micro-averaging.** A score is rolled up
sample → task family → benchmark → capability, averaging at each level. If you instead pool every
sample and take one mean, then whichever benchmark happens to have the most rows decides the
capability score — FinanceReasoning's 2,238 questions would drown FinQA's 1,147, and a capability
would silently become "whatever the biggest dataset measures". Dataset size is an artifact of how
the data was collected; it is not a statement about what matters.

**An unmapped tag maps to nothing.** A sample whose ``capability_tags`` don't match any dimension
is excluded from every capability rollup rather than being guessed into one. An unmapped tag is a
configuration gap to notice and fix, not something to paper over with a default.

#: The metric that *measures* a dimension, where it is not the benchmark's headline metric.
#:
#: This map exists because of a contradiction that reached a real report: SMB-CFO scored
#: ``smb_cfo_refusal_correctness = 1.000`` — the model declined every unanswerable question, which is
#: the exact behaviour the benchmark rewards — while the calibration-and-refusal *capability* scored
#: **0.0**. Both numbers were in the same file.
#:
#: The cause: every dimension was fed the benchmark's **preferred** metric, which for SMB-CFO is
#: accuracy. Accuracy on an unanswerable question is *not applicable* — there is no number to get
#: right — so the refusal dimension was being scored on a metric that cannot apply to the samples in
#: it. A model that refused perfectly was reported as being incapable of refusing.
#:
#: A dimension is scored by the metric that measures it. Anything else is a category error that
#: happens to compile.
#:
#: The same error reached a real report a second time, through SECQUE, and it is worth stating
#: plainly because the number it produced was *flattering*. SECQUE's preferred metric is
#: ``secque_unsupported_numeric_claim`` — an **absence-of-hallucination rate**, i.e. "did this answer
#: avoid inventing a figure". Every dimension SECQUE's tags reach was fed that metric, so
#: ``document_grounding``, ``table_text_reasoning`` (and, before the tags were fixed,
#: ``analytical_insight``) all reported exactly **0.900**, and so did the Financial Core Score — for
#: the 3B *and* the 7B, identically.
#:
#: What the run actually measured, in the same file: the models agree with the expert's figures
#: **8 %** and **11 %** of the time, and name the **wrong company** in 41 % and 55 % of answers. The
#: two metrics that discriminate between the models fed no dimension at all, and a model that emitted
#: no numbers whatsoever would have scored **1.000** on "document grounding".
#:
#: Lookup is keyed ``(sample_id, metric_name)``, so naming a benchmark-specific metric here cannot
#: contaminate another benchmark: a FinanceBench sample has no ``secque_filing_identification``
#: result, so it falls through to its own preferred metric.
