"""Native, benchmark-specific metrics.

Each wrapped benchmark's own official evaluation method, preserved rather than flattened into a
generic score — and, where a metric is *not* the official one, named so that it cannot be mistaken
for it (``finqa_answer_accuracy`` is ours; ``finqa_execution_accuracy`` is FinQA's). Parity against
the real official evaluators is asserted in ``tests/parity/``.

Importing this package registers every native metric implemented so far.
