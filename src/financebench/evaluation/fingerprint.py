"""The evaluator fingerprint — what makes two runs comparable, and what makes them not.

A benchmark's scores are only meaningful relative to the code that produced them. Last session
proved that the hard way: fixing the answer parser moved qwen2.5:3b's FinQA score from 5 % to 15 %
**on the same cached model responses**. Nothing about the model changed. If those two numbers had
been allowed to sit next to each other on a leaderboard, the leaderboard would have been lying.

So every run records an **evaluator fingerprint**: a hash over the versioned pieces of the
evaluation pipeline that can move a score without the model doing anything differently —

- the answer-parser version,
- the prompt-profile versions (what the model was *asked* for),
- the metric implementation versions,
- the dataset adapter versions (which data, pinned to which upstream commit),
- the scoring configuration (capability weights, gate thresholds).

Two runs with different fingerprints are **not comparable**, and `compare`/`leaderboard` say so
rather than quietly averaging them. The point is not to prevent the pipeline from improving — it is
to make an improvement *visible* instead of retroactively rewriting history.

Bumping a `*_VERSION` constant below is therefore a deliberate act: it declares "this change can
move a score, and old runs must not be compared to new ones without being re-scored."

#: The retrieval pipeline. It belongs in the fingerprint because it moves every
#: ``retrieval_required`` score without the model changing at all — which is exactly what happened.
#:
#: v2: ``document_scoped`` now actually narrows the corpus to the filing the question names. It used
#: to leave the retriever searching all 12,013 pages and merely paste the document's name onto the
#: front of the query, so a run artifact stamped ``document_scoped: true`` while nothing had been
#: scoped at all. The label described a setting the code never entered.
#:
#: The cost of that bug, measured: BM25 page recall @10 in the "document-scoped" run was **4.0 %** —
#: which is *precisely* the open-corpus number, because that is what it was actually doing. With the
#: corpus genuinely narrowed it is **18.7 %**, nearly five times better. Every v1 retrieval number
#: describes a setting nobody asked for.
RETRIEVAL_VERSION = "2"

#: Capability weights, gate thresholds, and how a per-sample result reaches a capability score.
#: Changing any of them moves every verdict.
#:
#: v2: a NOT-APPLICABLE result is excluded from the rollup instead of being scored as 0.0, and a
#: dimension is scored by the metric that measures it. Both bugs invented failures the model never
#: committed: on the real FinanceBench run, document grounding was reported as 0.151 when the truth
#: over the 89 gradable questions is 0.254. Every v1 capability score is wrong, low, and not
#: comparable with a v2 one — which is precisely what a scoring-version bump is for.
