"""Deterministic failure attribution.

"The model got 43 % " tells you almost nothing. *How* it fails is the whole question — a model that
is off by a rounding error is a different proposition from one that is off by a factor of a
thousand, and a model that confidently invents a number is a different proposition again from one
that says it doesn't know.

So every failed sample is classified, and the classification is **derived from the numbers**, not
guessed by a judge. Where a failure genuinely cannot be attributed it becomes ``WRONG_NUMBER``
rather than being forced into a bucket that flatters the taxonomy.

The dangerous classes — the ones that feed the critical gates — are the ones where the model is
confidently, catastrophically wrong: a wrong scale (out by 1000x), a %-vs-percentage-point mix-up,
a sign error. In a financial context those are not near-misses.
