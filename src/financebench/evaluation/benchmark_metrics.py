"""Which metrics apply to which run.

A metric is chosen by **(benchmark, prompt profile)**, not by benchmark alone. That is not
bookkeeping — it is the difference between an honest number and a fabricated one:

FinQA's official metrics (execution accuracy, program accuracy) are defined over a *predicted
program*. If the run asked the model for a plain number, there is no program to execute or
compare, and reporting "program accuracy: 0.0" would be a lie — the model was never asked. So a
direct-answer run gets ``finqa_answer_accuracy`` (ours, tolerance-based, named so it cannot be
mistaken for the official metric), and a ``program_v1`` run gets the two official ones.

``metric_details.jsonl`` records every applicable metric per sample; only the *preferred* one feeds
the capability-dimension rollup.
