"""Grounding, evidence, and hallucination metrics — **ours, not any benchmark's**.

FinanceBench ships no evaluator, so nothing here can claim to be official, and none of these
numbers may be compared with a published FinanceBench figure. They are named `financebench_*` so
that confusion is impossible.

The most important metric in this module is :class:`UnsupportedNumericClaim`, and it is worth
saying why.

A financial model's dangerous failure is not "wrong". It is **confidently wrong with a plausible
number** — a figure that looks like it came from the filing and did not. Answer accuracy cannot see
this: a model that hallucinates $1,577M when the answer is $1,577M scores identically to one that
read it off the page. So the check is *provenance*, not correctness: **every number the model
states must appear in the evidence it was given.** One that doesn't is an invented figure, and it
is a failure whether or not the final answer happened to be right.

This is fully deterministic, needs no judge, and applies to all 150 questions regardless of whether
the gold answer is a number, a yes/no, or an essay.
