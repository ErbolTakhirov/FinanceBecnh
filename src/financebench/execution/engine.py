"""The async run engine.

Each sample becomes exactly one model request in Milestone 1 (no cross-sample dependency yet —
ConvFinQA-style turn chaining, where a model's own prior answer feeds the next turn, is a
Milestone 4 extension of this engine, not a redesign of it). Samples run concurrently under a
bounded semaphore; ``asyncio.gather`` preserves input order in its results regardless of
completion order, so the returned predictions are byte-stable without needing a separate
collect-then-reorder step.

The response cache is consulted before every call and populated after every success — a cache
hit *is* how a resumed/re-run command avoids redoing work (see ``execution/cache.py``), not a
separate mechanism. A failed call is never cached, so a transient error doesn't get pinned.
