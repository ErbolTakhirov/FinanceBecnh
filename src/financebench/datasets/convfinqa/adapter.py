"""ConvFinQA — real conversations, not independent questions dressed up as one.

The whole point of ConvFinQA is that a turn **does not stand alone**. Turn 1 of a real conversation
is *"and what was it in 2005?"* — a question with no meaning whatsoever without turn 0. Flattening
these into independent QA pairs, which is the tempting shortcut, destroys the only thing the dataset
measures.

So conversations are preserved: `conversation_id`, turn order, the table and text context, and every
prior question and answer.

**Two protocols, never mixed into one score:**

- ``gold_history`` — each turn is given the *gold* prior conversation. This isolates per-turn
  reasoning: the model cannot be wrong at turn 3 because it was wrong at turn 1. It is also the
  official setting, and it is the one comparable with published numbers.
- ``model_history`` — each turn is given the model's **own** prior answers. This is what a real
  conversation actually is, and it is the only way to measure **error propagation**: one wrong
  answer at turn 1 poisons every turn that refers back to it.

The difference between the two is the interesting number. A model that scores well under
`gold_history` and collapses under `model_history` is a model that cannot hold a conversation,
however well it can answer a question.

Under ``gold_history`` the prior turns' *gold* answers legitimately enter the prompt — that is the
protocol. The **current** turn's gold never does, and the leakage suite has an explicit, narrow
exemption saying exactly that.

Data: `czyssrs/ConvFinQA` @ `cf3eed2`, MIT. dev = 421 conversations / 1,490 turns, gold public.
The test split's gold was never released (CodaLab submission only), so it is not supported here.
