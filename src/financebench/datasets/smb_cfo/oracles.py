"""The oracles. Every SMB-CFO gold answer is computed here, by Python, over the books.

**No LLM ever produces a gold answer.** A benchmark whose answers were written by a model inherits
that model's mistakes and then grades other models against them — which is not evaluation, it is
agreement-measurement. An oracle is a function you can read, disagree with, and test.

Everything is `Decimal`. Not fussiness: a benchmark that computes its own gold in binary floating
point will produce answers ending in `...0000001`, then grade a model wrong for saying the round
number that a human would. The money is exact, and the tolerance in the metric exists for the
*model's* rounding, not for ours.

Each oracle returns a :class:`OracleResult` carrying not just the number but its **unit, currency,
scale, period, and the exact rows it came from** — so a failure can be attributed (wrong period?
wrong currency? right number, wrong scale?) rather than just marked wrong.
