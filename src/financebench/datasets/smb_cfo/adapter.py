"""SMB-CFO: the deterministic, uncontaminated, bilingual small-business CFO benchmark.

Every gold answer here is produced by a Python oracle over generated books (`oracles.py`). No LLM
writes a gold answer, ever.

Splits:

- ``public`` — ~300 standard cases across 24 task families, EN.
- ``adversarial`` — ~150 traps and prompt injections.
- ``bilingual`` — ~100 EN/RU **paired** cases: the same business, the same oracle, the same gold
  value, asked in two languages. A gap between them is therefore a gap in the model, not in the
  phrasing — which is the only way an EN/RU number means anything.
- ``smoke`` — a tiny stratified slice for fast checks.

The **private** variant is generated from a secret seed supplied via ``SMB_CFO_SECRET_SEED``. The
seed is never committed; only its hash goes into the run metadata. That is what makes an
uncontaminated benchmark stay uncontaminated: the public cases will eventually leak into somebody's
training data, and when they do, the private ones will still be clean, and the gap between them
becomes the measurement.
