"""Dataset adapters: the ``DatasetAdapter`` contract, the registry, and every built-in adapter.

Importing this package registers all of them, so CLI code should ``import financebench.datasets``
rather than a specific adapter module — the registry is then always fully populated.

``smoke`` is a pipeline fixture, **not a benchmark**. It exists to prove the CLI/engine/cache/
metrics/artifacts chain works offline, and its scores are never evidence of financial capability.
