"""SECQUE — 565 expert-written financial-analysis tasks over real SEC filings.

This is the benchmark that most tempts a platform to lie, and it is worth being explicit about why.

Its gold is a **narrative expert answer**, not a number. There is no exact-match to fall back on. So
there are exactly three things you can do with it, and only two of them are honest:

1. Grade the parts that *are* deterministically checkable — the numbers, the ratio, the direction of a
   comparison, the company, the period. That is real, and it is what ``evaluation/native/secque.py``
   does. It is called **diagnostics**, not a score, because it is not one.
2. Have a *calibrated* judge grade the analytical quality, and report the calibration alongside it so a
   reader can decide whether to believe it (``evaluation/judge/``).
3. Invent a number. This is the tempting one — a benchmark with no score looks broken — and it is
   the reason SECQUE is where an evaluation suite usually starts lying.

The categories are not interchangeable, and this matters more than it looks:

- **Ratio** (188) — the reference contains a formula, its operands, and a final value. Almost fully
  checkable deterministically.
- **Comparison** (220) — the reference contains figures per year and a direction of travel. Largely
  checkable.
- **Analysis** (72) — a number, then an interpretation of it. Half checkable.
- **Risk** (85) — *"cybersecurity, fraud, and data protection…"*. **Essentially no numbers at all.**

So a deterministic metric applied to the Risk split would be scoring an essay on its arithmetic. Those
samples return ``passed=None`` — *not applicable* — and never a zero. A zero would say "the model
failed"; the truth is "this metric cannot see this question".

Data: HuggingFace ``nogabenyoash/SecQue`` @ ``894196b8``, **MIT**, public, no auth. Four JSONL files,
565 rows, every field populated. Checksums pinned below: the benchmark is only reproducible if the
bytes are the same bytes.
