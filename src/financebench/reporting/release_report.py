"""The primary public report: can qwen2.5:3b or qwen2.5:7b be trusted with money?

The answer, throughout, is expressed in what was **measured** — and the report's most important job is
to be equally clear about what was not. Three things it will never do:

- print a Finance Capability Index for a run whose coverage does not support one (it prints
  ``INSUFFICIENT_COVERAGE``, and says which coverage was missing);
- print `0.0` where the truth is "not measured" (it prints `NOT_EVALUATED`, or a dash);
- present two runs side by side when a different evaluator produced them.
