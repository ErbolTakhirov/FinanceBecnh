"""The report a human actually reads: can this model be trusted with money?

Every other artifact in this platform is written for a machine or for an auditor — predictions,
metric details, gates, fingerprints. This one is written for the person deciding whether to point a
model at their books, and it answers the five questions the platform exists to answer:

1. Can it calculate?
2. Can it reason over tables, text, and conversations?
3. Can it find and cite evidence in a real document?
4. Can it give useful CFO analysis for a small business?
5. Does it know when it *cannot* answer — and can it be talked into lying by its own data?

Three rules govern what goes in it, and they are all the same rule:

- **A question with no run behind it is reported as unanswered**, not as a zero. An empty section
  says "we did not measure this". A 0.0 says "we measured this and the model failed", and those are
  different sentences.
- **Numbers that are not comparable are not put next to each other.** Two runs with different
  evaluator fingerprints measured different things; showing them in one column would invite a
  comparison the evidence does not support.
- **The verdict is never better than the worst critical gate.** A strong average cannot buy off a
  model that invents figures, and the report does not let it try.

Self-contained: one HTML file, no external CSS, no fonts, no scripts, no network. It can be emailed,
committed, or opened on a machine that has never heard of this repository.
